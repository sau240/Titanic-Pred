# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers during the Titanic disaster using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. It serves as an inspiration and foundation for learning predictive modeling, dataset optimization, and building future ML/DL-based solutions.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic sinking.
- Explore data preprocessing, feature engineering, and imputation techniques.
- Train and evaluate ML models to maximize accuracy.
- Serve as a beginner-friendly introduction to supervised learning.

## 🗂️ Dataset

We use the **Titanic dataset** from [Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). It includes passenger details like:

- Name, Age, Gender
- Passenger class
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Number of parents/children aboard
- Fare paid
- Port of embarkation
- Survival status (target)

---

## 🔍 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Imputation of missing values using `SimpleImputer`
- Feature selection and encoding
- Model training using various algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
